=begin
Write a method leap_year?. It should accept a year value from the user, check whether it's a leap year, 
and then return true or false. With the help of this leap_year?() method calculate and display the number of minutes 
in a leap year (2000 and 2004) and the number of minutes in a non-leap year 
(1900 and 2005). Note: a century year, like 1900 and 2000, is a leap year only if it is 
divisible by 400.
